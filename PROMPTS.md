# Day 1 - Initial Setup & AI Integration

## What I Accomplished:
- Set up Cloudflare Worker from scratch
- Integrated Workers AI with Llama 3.1
- Added KV storage for conversation memory
- Deployed live at: https://cf-ai-chatbot.kaan-ai-chatbot.workers.dev/

## Learning Process:
- Learned Workers AI binding configuration
- Figured out KV namespace setup and basic operations
- Structured conversation data with timestamps
- Worked through deployment issues independently

## Key Code Decisions:
- Used single KV key for conversation history
- Structured data as JSON with human/ai/timestamp
- Chose Llama 3.3 for the AI model

# AI Prompts Used

## Research Phase
- "How do I set up Cloudflare Workers AI?"
- "What's the difference between Llama 3.1 and 3.3 models?"
- "How to use KV storage in Cloudflare Workers?"

## Problem-Solving
- "I'm getting this error: X, how do I fix it?"
- "How should I structure conversation data in KV?"

# Day 2 - Memory System & Interactive Chat

## What I Accomplished:
- Upgraded to Llama 3.3 as recommended
- Implemented POST request handling for interactive chat
- Made AI use conversation history from KV storage
- Tested and verified memory system works

## Learning Process:
- Learned how to structure AI message history with proper roles
- Figured out spread operator for conversation arrays
- Understood AI message format (system/user/assistant roles)
- Tested memory functionality with sequential questions

# AI Prompts Used

## Technical Implementation
- "How to structure conversation history for Cloudflare Workers AI messages array?"
- "What's the correct way to use spread operator with AI messages in Workers?"
- "How to parse JSON history and convert to AI message format?"

## Debugging & Problem-Solving
- "Debugging: AI not remembering conversation history - checking message structure"
- "How to handle empty history for first message in conversation?"
- "Best practices for error handling in Cloudflare Workers POST requests"

## Architecture Questions
- "What are the required message roles for Llama 3.3 conversation history?"
- "Should conversation history include system messages or just user/assistant?"
- "How to test if AI memory is working with curl commands?"
