# Day 1 - Initial Setup & AI Integration

## What I Accomplished:
- Set up Cloudflare Worker from scratch
- Integrated Workers AI with Llama 3.1
- Added KV storage for conversation memory
- Deployed live at: https://cf-ai-chatbot.kaan-ai-chatbot.workers.dev/

## Learning Process:
- Learned Workers AI binding configuration
- Figured out KV namespace setup and basic operations
- Structured conversation data with timestamps
- Worked through deployment issues independently

## Key Code Decisions:
- Used single KV key for conversation history
- Structured data as JSON with human/ai/timestamp
- Chose Llama 3.3 for the AI model

# AI Prompts Used

## Research Phase
- "How do I set up Cloudflare Workers AI?"
- "What's the difference between Llama 3.1 and 3.3 models?"
- "How to use KV storage in Cloudflare Workers?"

## Problem-Solving
- "I'm getting this error: X, how do I fix it?"
- "How should I structure conversation data in KV?"
